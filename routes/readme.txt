The Tinder for Study Buddies!

Studiosus is different from other solutions in that it:
-Adds students to a database specific to the institution
-Matches students based on their enrolled (selected) course
-Displays learning styles, group preferences, and study locations

Product Vision:
We help students connect with their classmates.
We encourage students to work together.
We make finding study groups easier.

How it should work:
1. A user registers for an account with their first and last name, email, password, and university/institution. This email is stored in the database. There is one database per institution, that holds the corresponding students.
2. The user's first name will appear on the profile. The user can edit their profile to include a picture, a bio, a course/class, learning styles, preferred study group size, noise factor, and study locations.
3. The user can edit settings to search for other people based on a course/class, learning styles, preferred study group size, noise factor, and study locations.
4. On the discover panel, an image of a student that matches the settings criteria will appear. Below this image is the student's first name, bio, and courses. If the user clicks on the image, it will take them to the student's profile page, complete with the student's study preferences. There will be two buttons, a like and dislike button. 
5. If the user clicks the dislike button, the student's profile will disappear, and a new one will appear.
6. If the user clicks the like button, and the student has clicked "like" for the user, then a match will occur.
7. If a match occurs, then the user will be able to see the student they have matched with in the chat pane. They can click on that student's image, and begin chatting with them via Instant Message.

What we accomplished:
1. Set up a mean stack structure.
2. Set up the database that holds user's first and last names, emails, passwords, and university.
3. Wrote the skeleton of the desired UI features, including warning messages, theme colors, and icons.

Setbacks:
1. Failed to find a resource built around the mean stack. Every resource we viewed had a completely different project structure. It's hard to keep up with JavaScript files and where they point to.
2. Experienced difficulty understanding and using the syntax between Jade and HTML, and relating them to the express framework.
3. Failed to connect the back-end to the front-end.
